    "description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*LIyqObLKQG7n6jbYF35eRg.jpeg\"><\/figure><p>Many think that in order to have a career in technology you have to know how to code, but nothing could be further from the truth. A career in technology isn\u2019t just for techies: there are tons of ways to get into the field without an extensively technical background.<\/p>\n<p>Here are seven jobs you can land in the tech industry that don\u2019t require any programming knowledge:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>1. Technical Writer<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Being a technical writer is a great job for someone with a knack for bridging the gap between technical and non-technical audiences. Technical writers often leverage their background knowledge of how a technology works in order to transform complex, technically specific information into material consumable by other target audiences. The final products from a technical writer might be manuals, project reports, journal articles, other documentation, and\u00a0more.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. Software Sales Representative<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A software sales representative needs to have a knowledge of how a software product works and be able to communicate what it does to potential customers. Often, people in this role can leverage having studied technology in an undergraduate program though they do not work in an inherently technical role. Sales representatives help a company grow their customer base and must exercise strong customer relationship management as\u00a0well.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>3. Web Analytics\/SEO Specialist<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Someone working with web analytics and SEO needs to leverage an awareness of data analytics and search algorithms with the goal of increasing page views, increasing viewer to customer conversation rates, and improving ease of use of the website overall. Someone with this role might also oversee decisions relating to the development, deployment and maintenance of the\u00a0website.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>4. UI\/UX\u00a0Designer<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Have you ever visited a website and thought \u201cwow, I would love to change how this website is laid out\u201d? Well, a career in UI (user experience) or UX (user experience) might be where you want to look. A UI\/UX designer looks at how to create user-friendly interfaces by thinking about an array of different elements like typical user behaviour, information architecture, visual communication, visual appeal and\u00a0more.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Product\u00a0Manager<\/h4>\n<p>Product managers are responsible for looking at the scope of a product and seeing it through. This involves determining business objectives for the product, defining what success looks like, and outlining high-level product functionality. Someone in this role needs to have an awareness of all the different teams that go into launching a product; design, software, marketing, finance, you name\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<h4>6. Marketing Engineer<\/h4>\n<p>Marketing engineers help the sales team and potential clients understand the technical capabilities of a product or service. People in this role have an ability to communicate technical information in a digestible way, and can apply their technical knowledge to sales and marketing campaigns. This type of career would be great for someone torn between the marketing \/ business side of things and a career in engineering. The intersection of these two fields is an important one.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Business\u00a0Analyst<\/h4>\n<p>A business analyst works towards improving an organization\u2019s efficiency and operations. This can include reducing costs and increasing revenue to make a company more profitable, developing strategies to optimize organization resources, and creating strategies for organization market growth. This type of career translates across multiple industries, but the technology industry lends itself to this role naturally as both optimization-related technologies develop and products provided by organizations shift.<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/_\/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=bed23c3b5356\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/cutc-blog\/7-tech-jobs-you-can-land-without-knowing-how-to-code-bed23c3b5356\">7 Tech Jobs You Can Land Without Knowing How To Code<\/a> was originally published in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/cutc-blog\">CUTC Blog<\/a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.<\/p>\n"
