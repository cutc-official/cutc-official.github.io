### The official CUTC 2021 website!
Welcome!
#### Running the website locally
- clone the repository with git
- npm install

## Marketing Team
The tech team should have made it as easy as possible for you to make edits to your work. All of it should be within the **content** folder. From there you should see multiple JSON files relating to different components of the website. Feel free to make edits on the staging branch!

## Tech Team
Few tips for our lovely team :)
- Never push to main (only PRs)
- Organize
- All content from marketing & design goes in the content folder
- Assets folder is prioritized over public, unless absolutely necessary
#### Happy coding!
